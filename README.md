# Univariate-Multistep-Stock-Price-Prediction

Build a future stock price forecast application with univariate model using some deep learning algorithm like LSTM, CNN, and GRU. The dataset was obtained from the official website https://finance.yahoo.com/. I created this application using the Plotly Dash framework with HTML and CSS for the entire modeling process and visualization result.
